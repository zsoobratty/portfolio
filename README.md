## <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a>

I am a full stack developer looking for a full time role in the industry.

Having recently graduated from Makers Academy, a 16 week full-time software development boot camp, I am now looking to show the skills I have developed before and during the course.

Prior to Makers, I was a client servicing consultant at Aviva. Having spent a lot of my role liaising and assisting developers, I thought to myself - hey, why not learn the skills to become one?

Here are some of the projects I've created on my journey to becoming a software developer:

#### Leading

As a client servicing consultant at Aviva, I was regularly entrusted to organise and lead meetings with the most lucrative clients we had, in order rekindle the relationship with the client, and work with them to improve service levels. Due to this, we were able to maintain a solid relationship with them, and ensure that our reputation as an insurer remained at the highest level. These contributed to obtaining a further investment of £600m from the client.

#### Cooking 

Recreating meals that I've had at restaurants is a huge hobby of mine. From making the Wagamama Katsu Curry, to replicating the famous Big Mac.  
The possibilities are endless!

#### Piano

So I was playing a game called Final Fantasy X, and on comes a nice tune called 'To Zanarkand', played on the piano. Inspired by it, I went and bought myself a piano with the sole purpose of playing that song.  
With sheer determination, and a significant amount of YouTube videos, I was able to do it!  
Next on the list to learn: Nuvole Bianche, by Ludovico Einaudi.
